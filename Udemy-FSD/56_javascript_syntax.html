    <!-- javascript is what gives interactivity to our website,any intereaction of the client/user
    on a web page is done with the help of javascript.
        
        the three ways of writing javascript is either through linking a .js file or through 
    <script> tag. the <script> tag can be placed at the head of the HTML or the top of the body,
    or even at the bottom of the body.

        since our files runs from top to bottom it is a better option to write the script 
    at the bottom of the body. the sole reason for it being so that to allow our javascript to execute 
    properly for a particular html tag.
    -->
    <!-- let's look at a simple example of javascript -->
    <script>
        var name = "Amaan";
        if(name == "Amaan"){
            console.log("Hello World");
            console.log("Function operation below");
        }
        function greeting(name){
            return `Hello ${name}, How are you?`;
        }
        const greet = greeting("Amaan");
        console.log(greet);
    </script>
</body>
