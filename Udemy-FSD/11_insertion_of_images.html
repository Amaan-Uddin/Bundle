        <h2>Let's add some images to our webpage: 101</h2>
        <div>
            To add an image we use the tag img which <b>does not</b> have any closing tag <br>
            as there's no text to go along with it, only attributes.<br>
            <div>
                <h2><b>such as:</b></h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.src for image source<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.width<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.height<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.alt to display an alt message when the image isn't shown.
            </div>

            <h2>Image</h2>
            <img src = "C:\Users\user\Desktop\Amaan's folder\iphone_img.jpg" 
                width = "500"
                alt = "show"
