        although it will return it's typeof() as a string.

        example: age = "19";
        this is a string variable but we can perform any arthimetic operations on this string 
        as it only contains integers.

        so, age * 2;
        output: 38

        but if there are a sequence of characters in the string then the arthmetic operations 
        are invalid and cannot be performed
