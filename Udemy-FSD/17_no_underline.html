            CSS attributes
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>
           HTML 201: 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            CSS Style attribute:
        </h3>
        <div>
            As we all are aware of the <b><strong>&lt;u&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;</strong></b> underline tag which would underline the text within it. 
            <div>
                But it's use is inconvineant and too old, so instead we use the css attribute or  css <b><strong>"style"</strong></b>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            It goes as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>First you place the <b><strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong></b> tag.</li>
                <li>Next up you give it an attribute <span style = "text-decoration: underline;"><b><strong>" style = "text-decoration: <i>* your prefered action *</i>; " "</strong></b></span></li>
                <li>insert some text in between.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
    </body>
