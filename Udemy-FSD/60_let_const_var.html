    <!-- 'let' and 'const' are the modern day new variables.
    
        let: mutable and value of the variable can be re-asigned or changed
        const: not-mutable, once declared the variable cannot be changed/overite.

        let and const unlike var are heavily influenced by their scope(global/local) , i.e 
        depends on where the variable has been defined and under whome.

            let apples = 5;
            const height = "5'7\"";
            // apples / let variable can be changed anywhere, even in the console tab.
            // const remains constant as the name suggest.
            console.log("I have",apples,"Apples");
            
            console.log("My name is",name);
            // example of how the scope of var does not matter.
        }
        // console.log("I have ",apples," Apples");
        // the above code statement will generate an error as the variables apples and height heavily
        // rely on their scope and act accordingly
        // where as var is not depending on it's scope.
