            Let's discuss about how we could give our table elements some <b><strong>width</strong></b> and <b><strong>height</strong></b> and while we are at it let's add some <b><u>padding</u></b> to it as well.
        </div>

        <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Create A Table:</span></h3>
        <table width="100%">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th style="padding: 10px;" colspan="2">First Row</th>
                    <!-- <th> is differenet from our usual <td> , it's a header tag which also bolden the font-->
                    <!-- here we are using some css style attributes to add a padding of 10px from all sides-->
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td width="50%" style="text-align:center;">second row</td>
                    <!-- css style "text-align: center;" used to keep the text at the centre of the row/column inside our table
                    We are using width 50% becuase when we add another column to our row and this new column contains more characters 
                    or the length of this column is greater than the previous column the program adjusts it on its own but the result isn't quite satisfactory 
                    as isually it isn't a perfect half so we are dynamically makin the width of the previous column 50%-->
                    <td style="text-align:center;">second row second column</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </body>
