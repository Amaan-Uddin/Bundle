        /* the try and catch and finally is not commonly used in JS, it's more of a python thing.
        but none the less it is quite helpful
        think of it just like "try" and "except"*/

        try{
            functionWhichDoesNotExist();
        } catch(error){
            console.warn("Hello Lads , there's an ERROR!!")
        }

        // so what's happening here is that our "block" tries to execute a function which isn't defined
        // and sends the controle flow to catch witch later on executes a console.warn()
        console.log("hello world")


        // now if we want to we can display our own error by giving it a name by using "throw" keyword

        try {
            throw "INSERT Error Name...";
            console.log("hello there m howdy??????")

            console.warn("caught the error")
            console.log(error)

        // now keep in mind that when we give a console.log() statement inside of our "try" function, and 
        // and if any events before that console.log() lead to an error , that console.log() will not be displayed
        // in our console.

        // also keep in mind that our throw function throws an error named by the user to our catch block

        // the finally{} is basically what is executed regardless of whether try or catch

        let num = 10
        try {
            // throw "const error!"
            num*=10

            console.warn("ERROR LOG:",error)
            num-=10
        }finally{
            if(!num) {
                console.log("catch was executed")
                console.log(num)
