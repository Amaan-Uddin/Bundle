    <!-- in this section we will be discussing about a small topic regarding comparison
    specifically "===" or strict comparision -->

    <!-- 
        so the basic idea behind strict comparision is to check if the 2 values being compared are 
        exactly identical or not , ranging from its type to it's value
     -->
     <script>
        //  example
        const number = "1";
        // now from the above line of code we can conclude that our number variable is infact of string datatype
        // the value between the ""(quotation) is a number, a pure/vanilla integer.
        // since it's an integer value with string datatype, we can perform arthemitic operations on it.


        // example of arithemitic operations
        console.log(number * 2);


        console.log(number == 1);
        // comparing a string-type integer with an actual integer
        
        // now let's use a strict comparision operator
        console.log(number === 1);

        // strict comaprisions are much faster compared to normal comparison and yeild accurate results
     </script>
