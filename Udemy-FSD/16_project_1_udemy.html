        <h1>Project HTML 1:</h1>
        <h3><u>Syntax:</u></h3>
        <div>
            The syntax for our html is quite simple, it consists of an opening tag and a closing tag.
            <div>
                For Ex. <b>"&lt;element&gt;"</b> and <b>"&lt;/element&gt;"</b>.
                <div>
                    The text between our element tag will be executed <u>according to the properties</u> of our tag.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <h3><u>Base Structure:</u></h3>
        <div>
            The <b>Base Structure</b> of our html project consists of <u>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</u>, this informs the browser that the file being executed/runned is a html file.
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div>
            Next up we use the the &lt;html&gt; tag so we could give it a proper foundation.
            <div>
                The &lt;html&gt; tag consist of &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags/elements 
                <div>
                    We could give a title to our webpage inside of our &lt;head&gt; tag and at the same time we could use it to style our &lt;body&gt; using <b>CSS</b>.
                    <div>
                        The &lt;body&gt; is where the real html  coding takes place. The <b>MAIN</b> part of any html programs.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <h3><u>Nesting in HTML5:</u></h3>
        <div>
            Nesting in <b>HTML</b> is not as similer to what we learne in python, although it is a code within a code.
            <div>
                <h4><u>The actual terminology is taken as such:</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When talking about an element , we consider that element as the <b>&lt;parent&gt;</b> element </li>
                    <li>What ever is given inside of the specific "parent" element is now considered as the <b>&lt;child&gt;</b> of that &lt;parent&gt; element. </li>
                    <li>When dealing with nested elements you should make sure all the code is under <u><b>proper indentation</b></u>.</li>
                    <li>often times we use the <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> element as it has no special property/meaning and is best suited for nesting problems.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    keep in mind that <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> is block element and it takes up all the white spaces which are left in that <u>specific</u> block.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <h3><u>Block and Inline Elements:</u></h3>
        <div>
            As we have discused in the previous section <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> is an great example of a block-element. 
            <div> A <b>Block</b> element takes up extra space i.e. <u>White Space</u>. If you want to check it out for yourself..
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to any webpage and <u><strong>Right-click</strong></u></li>
                    <li>Press the <b>Inspect</b> option and you can now view the <b>Source Code</b> of that webpage.</li>
                    <li>Hover over a block on that webpage and you can see it being highlighted.</li>
                    <li>Once <b>highlighted</b> you can see that the <b><i>Block element</i></b> takes up even the white spaces.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            &nbsp;
            <div>
                Next up we got our <b>Inline</b> element.
                <div>
                    An <b>Inline-element</b> takes up only the specific <i>text</i> present inside of it. If you want to check it out for yourself...
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to any webpage and <u><strong>Right-click</strong></u></li>
                            <li>Press the <b>Inspect</b> option and you can now view the <b>Source Code</b> of that webpage.</li>
                            <li>Hover over a Inline tag on that webpage and you can see it being highlighted.</li>
                            <li>Once <b>highlighted</b> you can see that the <b><i>Inline element</i></b> only takes up the specific text present inside of it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <h3><u>Link:</u></h3>
        <div>
            When you browse through different webpages you might come across a link which looks like <a href=> This </a>
            <div> 
                These are called <b><strong>Link</strong></b>(s) and upon interacting with it you'll be lead to another webpage or even another website.
            </div>
            &nbsp;
            <div> 
                To create a link is simple, all you need is the <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;/a&gt;</b> tags.
                <div> 
                    The "a" stands for <b>"Anchor"</b> or <b>"hyper-text-anchor"</b>, the most frequently used attributes with it are "<b>href</b>" and "<b>target</b>" 
                </div>
            </div>
            &nbsp;
            <div>
                <b><strong>href</strong></b> stands for <b>"hyper-text-reference"</b> and is where we write down the actual link or path to it.
                <div>
                    <b><strong>target</strong></b> is the other frequently used attribute of our <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> tag. 
                    <div>
                        The purpose of the <b><strong>target</strong></b> attribute is it can open our <i>"href"</i> link in another <b>tab</b>.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div> 
        &nbsp;
        <h3><u>Image Insertion:</u></h3>
        <div>
            We use images in our webpage to make it more presentable and beautiful.
            <div>
                Inserting an image in your webpage is quite simple than it looks, all you need to make sure is that the <b><strong>image</strong></b> is present in your folder.
            </div> 
            &nbsp;
            <div>
                To Insert an image or to add an image to your webpage you will need to use the <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag , and the most <b><u>important</u></b> attribute used is "<b>src</b>".
                <div>
                    <b>src</b> stands for <b>"source"</b> , and you need to specify the relative or complete path of your image in here.
                </div>
                &nbsp;
                <div>
                    Other useful attributes are the "<b>width</b>","<b>height</b>","<b>alt</b>".
                    <div>
                        The <b><strong>alt</strong></b> attribute will display a <u>message</u> if the image file is corrupt,notfound or if it doesn't exist.
                    </div>
                </div>
                &nbsp;
                <li>You can even link an image to another webpage by nesting the <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag/element inside of the <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> tag. </li>
                <li>Make sure that all the attribute values are given in <b><strong><i>string format</i></strong></b>.</li>
            </div>
