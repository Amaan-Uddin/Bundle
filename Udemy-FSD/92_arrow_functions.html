        arrow functions are generally used in modern javascript and helps reduce the workload.
        it is Quick, and efficient in some cases, cases where we do not require the scope of the 'this'
        to be bounded within a particular object
        */

        // the old way of writing a function in javascript
        // method 1
        function greetings1(name){
            console.log(`Hello world! How are you ${name}?`)
        }

        // method 2
        const greetings2 = function(name){
            console.log(`Good afternoon ${name}`)
        }

        // now let's write a function using the arrow function =>
        // method 3
        const greetings3 = (name) => {
            console.log(`Good evening ${name}`)
        }

        // method 4 *this method is used to define a single line functions*
        const greetings4 = (name) => `lorem ipsum ${name}`

        // now let's call these functions
        const name = prompt("What is your name?")
        greetings1(name)
        greetings2(name)
        greetings3(name)
        // greetings4(name)
        console.log(greetings4(name))

        // NOTE: since we did not give our greetings4() function a console.log() function inside it's scope
        // and the only purpose of the function is to return a string with a given argument

        /*
            the key difference between a normal function and an arrow function is that in a normal function
            the 'this' keyword is bounded to the scope of the function meaing that the function is an object 
            with it's own set or code

            whereas in an function defined using a arrow function the scope is global and the 'this' keyword 
            is not set or limited to a specific bound or scope and is global

            NOTE: the 'this' keyword inside of a standard function will refer to that as an object 
            eg: function funName(parameter){
                ...
                this
            }
            here this refers to the entire local scope of the function

            const funName2 = (parameter) => {
                ...
                this
            } 
            in here the 'this' is not bounded to the function and can refer to the entire global scope as 
            an object
