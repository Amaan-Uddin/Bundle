        <p>
            In this section we are going to be learning about <u><b>div element.</b></u>
        </p>

        <!-- div is a dummy element , it has no special meaning to it and is also a block element.-->
        <div>
            this right here is 1 div block. and it alone takes up the entire block/space
            <div>
                Now this rigth here is the nested div and is a part of the parent div element.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            Where as this is not the part of our previous parent div, it's a seperate block in itself.
        </div>
