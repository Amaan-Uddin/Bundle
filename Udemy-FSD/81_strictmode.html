        // strict mode prevent programers from writing loosely written code in JS
        // all you need to do to enable strict mode is
        "use strict";
        // the above line of code is enough to enable strict mode and prevent loosely written code from being executed

        // example
        // x = "thing";
        // now this will generate an error when executing JS because eventhough the varibale is defined it isn't declared as 'var' 'let' or 'const'
        // but if we were to define the variable and assign a value it
        let x = "thing";
        console.log(x);
        // now if we were to change the value of the variable down the road to something else it won't display an error for not defining it
        x = "somethig else";
        console.log(x);

        // strict mode is benificial in cases where you want to make sure that there aren't any typos in your program
        // which might hold some crucial data

        // example
        let y = "something";
        //
        // some logic
        // 
        t = "new value"; // will generate an error as "t" is not defined
        console.log(y);
        // now here by enabling strict mode we can easily make sure that the data isn't passed down to an varibale which wasn't defined previsouly.
